```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                       MasterMind :: Escape the Room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"You have been locked in an empty dark room, running out of food and water. 
In front of you, there is a gate with a giant lock. The times you can enter 
the numbers into the lock is limited! Once you ran out of the times, the 
gate will lock forever! Hurry up! Clock is ticking......"

If you enter all correct elements with correct position into the lock in the
limited times, the gate will open. That you can escape the room. Otherwise, 
you will be lock in the room forever......
 
 [S] to start the game.
 
 [H] for help, display game rule.

```

The above text is the main page of the game, it will stored in this text file **`masterMindMainPage.txt`**. It will load and display at the beginning of the game for player to read.

```

                       MasterMind :: Escape the Room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Three levels of this game:

 [1] wood gate = easy, 4 elements out of 6 with 10 times to try.
 
 [2] Rock gate = tricky: 5 elements out of 8 with 12 times to try.
 
 [3] Iron gate = hard: 6 elements out of 10 with 14 times to try.

After you enter the elements into the lock, the lock will provide you some clues.

- One `#` will show up if you enter a correct element in correct position.

- One `*` will show up if you enter a correct element in wrong position.

- No symbol for a worng element

- The order of symbols to show up is random in each time.

The way to caculate the points for each game:

1. The points for wood gate start from 100, rock gate start from 180 and
   iron gate start from 280.

3. Each time will cost you 10 points in wood gate, 15 points in rock gate,
   20 points in iron gate.

4. 2 points for one `#`, 1 point for one `*`.

5. Maximum points for opening wood gate is 98, that is four `#` in 1 time.
   Maximum 175 points for rock gate and maximum 272 points for iron gate.

6. The points you get from each game will add up to your total points.
```

The above text is the game rule, it will stored in this text file **`masterMindHelp.txt`**. It will load and display when user press `[H]` for player to read.

The text above is the game rule of Master Mind :: Escape the Room. 

It separate into two parts:

1. The first 3 lines start with "~"" and end with "~" as the title. It display by a function **`displayTitle()`**. 

2. The second part is the body after the "~", store in a text file **`masterMindRules.txt`**.

The text above also store as a help page, it will display if player press `[H]` during the game.


## Development outline of Master Mind :: Escape the Room

## Outline the functionality of all game classes

After reading the assignment brief, I decided to use 3 classes for this game.

1. **Player class**

**Player class** is

2. **Board class**

**Board class** is 

3. **Application file**

**Application file** include


## The game setup

Four step for game setup:

1. Display the title of the game.

2. Load and display the **`masterMindRules.txt`** and include a "Press any key to continue" to pause the screen, allow player to read the game rules.

3. After player finishes reading the game rule, that is press a key to continue. Initials the game variables:

* Ask the name of player, store as a *string* **`playerNmae`**.
  
* Ask the player to select the gate to open, that is the game difficulty level. Store as a *int* **`difficultyLevel`**, possible value is {1, 2, 3}.

* Create a *int* **`possibleElement`** = 3 + 2* **`difficultyLevel`** to indicate the number of all possible elements, possible value is {6, 8, 10}.

* Create a *int* **`codeElement`** = 4 + **`difficultyLevel`** to indicate the number of elements in one row, that is the numbers of element in the secret code. Possible value is {4, 5, 6}.

* Create a *intr* **`codeRow`** = 8 + 2 * **`difficultyLevel`** to indicate the number of rows, that is the times players can try. Possible value is {10, 12, 14}.

* Ask the player what type of element they want to choose, store as a *int* **`elementType`**, possible value is {1, 2, 3, 4}

4. After player finish enter their name and game option, include a "Press any key to continue" in the end. To allow user final review the information before the screen be cleared.

What we need for game setup:

Functions:

1. **`displayTitle()`** to display the title of the game.

2. **`displayRule()`** to display **`masterMindRules.txt`**.

3. *int* **`askForNumber(string question)`** to display the question and ask user's choice, *string* **question** is the local variable within the function **`askForNumber()`**.

Variables:

1. *string* **`playerNmae`**

2. *int* **`difficultyLevel`**

3. *int* **`possibleElement`**

4. *int* **`codeElement`**

5. *int* **`codeRow`**

6. *int* **`elementType`**


## The player's turn

1. After the press a key to continue, clear the screen.

2. display the title of the game.

3.
